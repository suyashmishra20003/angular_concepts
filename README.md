Welcome, readers! Here, I aim to comprehensively document various Angular concepts with detailed examples and clear documentation.

Instructions:

- Each folder contains code and documentation for a specific Angular concept.
- The src folder within each concept holds all relevant code, meticulously commented for clarity.
- Please refer to the adjacent .md file for a detailed explanation of the concept, enriched with examples.
- Additionally, the .md file includes a dedicated section called "Questions for AI." Feel free to pose these questions to an AI for a more in-depth explanation.

Feel free to explore the folders and dive into the documentation to enhance your understanding of Angular concepts. If you have any questions, the "Questions for AI" section is designed to provide further clarification. Happy learning!
