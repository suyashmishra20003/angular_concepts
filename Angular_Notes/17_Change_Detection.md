# ChangeDetectionStrategy 

***ChangeDetectionStrategy*** is a feature in Angular that allows you to control how change detection is performed on a component. Change detection is the process by which Angular determines what has changed in the application state and updates the view accordingly.

## Types of ChangeDetectionStrategy
Angular provides two main change detection strategies:

- ***Default*** (ChangeDetectionStrategy.Default)
- ***OnPush*** (ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush)

### 1. Default (ChangeDetectionStrategy.Default)

- **Behavior**: 
    - Angular's default change detection strategy checks the entire component tree whenever any event occurs, such as a user interaction, a timer, or an asynchronous operation like an HTTP request. 
    - It checks all components for changes, even if their input properties haven't changed.

- **Use Case:** This strategy is straightforward and works well for most cases. It ensures that your components are always up-to-date with the latest application state.

- **How to Use:** This strategy is applied automatically, so you don't need to explicitly set it. However, you can still declare it if needed:

```ts
import { Component, ChangeDetectionStrategy } from '@angular/core';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-default-strategy',
  templateUrl: './default-strategy.component.html',
  changeDetection: ChangeDetectionStrategy.Default // This is the default setting
})
export class DefaultStrategyComponent {
  // Component logic here
}
```

### 2. OnPush (ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush)
- **Behavior:** OnPush is a more optimized strategy that tells Angular to check the component and its subtree only when specific conditions are met:

    - An input property bound to the component changes.
    - An event originates from within the component.
    - You manually trigger change detection using ChangeDetectorRef.

- **Use Case:** This strategy is ideal for scenarios where your components rely on immutable data or you want to improve performance by reducing unnecessary change detection cycles. It works well in applications that use libraries like NgRx for state management, where data changes are predictable and managed externally.

- **How to Use:** You can apply the OnPush strategy to a component like this:

```ts
import { Component, ChangeDetectionStrategy, Input } from '@angular/core';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-on-push-strategy',
  templateUrl: './on-push-strategy.component.html',
  changeDetection: ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush
})
export class OnPushStrategyComponent {
  @Input() data: any;
  // Component logic here
}
```
### How to Choose Between the Two
- **Default Strategy**: Use when you want Angular to handle change detection automatically without worrying about optimizing for performance.

- **OnPush Strategy**: Use when you are working with immutable data structures, when performance is critical, or when you want to have more control over when change detection occurs.

# ChangeDetectorRef


**ChangeDetectorRef** is a service in Angular that provides APIs to control and manipulate the change detection mechanism. It allows developers to programmatically trigger or pause change detection for a component, offering finer control over how and when the component's view is updated.

## Methods Provided by ChangeDetectorRef
- **detectChanges()**
- **markForCheck()**
- **detach()**
- **reattach()**
- **checkNoChanges()**

### 1. detectChanges()
- **Description**: This method manually triggers change detection for the current component and its children. Angular will check the component for any changes and update the view accordingly.

- **Use Case**: Use detectChanges() when you need to force Angular to check for changes outside of the usual change detection cycle. This is common in scenarios where changes happen outside Angular's zone, such as when working with third-party libraries or manual DOM manipulation.

```ts
import { ChangeDetectorRef, Component } from '@angular/core';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-example',
  template: `<div>{{ data }}</div>`
})
export class ExampleComponent {
  data: string = 'Initial Data';

  constructor(private cd: ChangeDetectorRef) {}

  updateData() {
    this.data = 'Updated Data';
    this.cd.detectChanges(); // Manually triggers change detection
  }
}
```


### 2. markForCheck()

- **Description**: Marks the component and its ancestors as needing change detection. The marked component will be checked on the next change detection cycle, regardless of whether it has any direct input changes.

- **Use Case**: Use markForCheck() when you want to ensure that a component is checked in the next change detection cycle, especially when using the OnPush change detection strategy.

- **Example**:

```typescript
Copy code
import { ChangeDetectorRef, Component } from '@angular/core';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-example',
  template: `<div>{{ data }}</div>`,
  changeDetection: ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush
})
export class ExampleComponent {
  data: string = 'Initial Data';

  constructor(private cd: ChangeDetectorRef) {}

  updateData() {
    this.data = 'Updated Data';
    this.cd.markForCheck(); // Marks component for check in the next cycle
  }
}
```


### 3. detach()
- **Description**: Detaches the component's change detector from the Angular change detection tree. Once detached, the component will not be checked for changes until reattached.

- **Use Case**: Use detach() when you want to stop change detection for a component, typically to improve performance in scenarios where the component's data does not change frequently.

**Example**:

```typescript
import { ChangeDetectorRef, Component } from '@angular/core';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-example',
  template: `<div>{{ data }}</div>`
})
export class ExampleComponent {
  data: string = 'Static Data';

  constructor(private cd: ChangeDetectorRef) {}

  ngOnInit() {
    this.cd.detach(); // Detaches the component from the change detection tree
  }

  updateData() {
    this.data = 'Updated Data';
    this.cd.detectChanges(); // You can still manually trigger change detection
  }
}
```

### 4. reattach()
- **Description**: Reattaches the component's change detector to the Angular change detection tree. This will resume normal change detection for the component.

- **Use Case**: Use reattach() after a component has been detached and you want to resume normal change detection.

- **Example**:

```typescript
import { ChangeDetectorRef, Component } from '@angular/core';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-example',
  template: `<div>{{ data }}</div>`
})
export class ExampleComponent {
  data: string = 'Initial Data';

  constructor(private cd: ChangeDetectorRef) {}

  ngOnInit() {
    this.cd.detach(); // Detaches the component from the change detection tree
  }

  resumeChangeDetection() {
    this.cd.reattach(); // Reattaches the component to the change detection tree
    this.cd.detectChanges(); // Optionally, trigger an immediate check
  }
}
```

### 5. checkNoChanges()
- **Description**: Checks the current view and throws an error if any changes are detected. This is primarily used in development mode to ensure that the application state is stable.

- **Use Case**: Use checkNoChanges() to enforce immutability and ensure that no unintended changes are happening between change detection cycles. It's mostly useful in debugging.

- **Example**:

```typescript
import { ChangeDetectorRef, Component } from '@angular/core';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-example',
  template: `<div>{{ data }}</div>`
})
export class ExampleComponent {
  data: string = 'Initial Data';

  constructor(private cd: ChangeDetectorRef) {}

  verifyState() {
    this.cd.checkNoChanges(); // Checks for unintended changes
  }
}
```
----------------------------
## Summary of Use Cases
- **detectChanges()**: When you need to manually trigger change detection.
- **markForCheck()**: When you want to ensure a component is checked in the next change detection cycle.
- **detach()**: When you want to stop change detection for performance reasons.
- **reattach()**: When you want to resume change detection after detachment.
- **checkNoChanges()**: When you want to ensure that no changes have occurred, typically used for debugging.

These methods provide powerful tools for optimizing and controlling Angular's change detection mechanism in your applications.
