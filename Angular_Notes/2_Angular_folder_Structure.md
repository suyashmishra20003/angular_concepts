# Angular Change Detection and file structure

## Angular Change Detection

Angular does not use a Virtual DOM (Document Object Model) like React does. Instead, Angular uses its own change detection mechanism to efficiently update the DOM.

### Component Tree

Angular applications are built using a component-based architecture. Each component represents a part of the user interface and may contain other components, forming a component tree.

### Identifying Changes

Angular's Change Detection mechanism identifies changes in the application's data model. This includes changes to component properties, input bindings, and other stateful data.

### Updating Component State

When a change is detected, Angular updates the internal state of the affected components. This may involve updating component properties, state variables, or other internal data structures.

### Re-rendering Components

Once the component state has been updated, Angular triggers a re-rendering of the affected components. This involves generating a new virtual DOM representation of the component's template.

### Diffing and Patching

Angular then performs a "diffing" operation to compare the new virtual DOM representation with the previous one. This process identifies the specific changes that need to be applied to the actual DOM.

### Applying Changes to the DOM

Finally, Angular applies the identified changes to the actual DOM, updating the UI to reflect the new state of the application. This may involve adding, removing, or modifying DOM elements, attributes, or text content.

### Efficiency

Angular's change detection mechanism is highly optimized and performs efficiently even with large component trees. It only updates the parts of the DOM that have changed, rather than re-rendering the entire DOM like React's Virtual DOM approach.

# Difference between React's Virtual DOM and Angular's Change Detection

Both React and Angular handle DOM updates efficiently, but they do so using different approaches, which can lead to some confusion. Here's a breakdown of how they differ:

### React's Virtual DOM

- ***Virtual DOM Concept:*** React uses a "virtual DOM," which is a lightweight, in-memory representation of the actual DOM. When the state of a component changes, React doesn't immediately update the real DOM. Instead, it creates a new virtual DOM tree, then compares it with the previous virtual DOM tree using a process called "reconciliation."

- ***Efficient Diffing:*** React's diffing algorithm identifies what has changed between the two versions of the virtual DOM. Once the differences are found, React updates only those parts of the real DOM that need to change, making the updates efficient.

- ***Batching Updates:*** React often batches multiple updates together, minimizing the number of times the actual DOM is touched, which improves performance.

### Angular's Change Detection and Incremental DOM

- ***Change Detection:*** Angular uses a mechanism called "change detection," where it checks if the data model (i.e., component state) has changed and then updates the DOM accordingly. Angular doesn't maintain a separate virtual DOM. Instead, it directly works with the actual DOM.

- ***Incremental DOM (in Ivy):*** With the introduction of Angular's Ivy renderer, Angular compiles templates into efficient incremental DOM instructions. When a change is detected, Angular doesn't compare entire DOM trees like React. Instead, it updates the DOM incrementally, based on the instructions generated during compilation.

- ***Dirty Checking:*** Angular uses a concept called "dirty checking" to track changes in component properties. When change detection runs, Angular checks each binding in the template to see if it needs to update the DOM.

- ***Change Detection Strategies:*** Angular provides two change detection strategiesâ€”Default and OnPush. The OnPush strategy is more similar to React's approach, where the change detection is more optimized, running only when the component's inputs change.

### Key Differences

- ***Virtual DOM vs. Incremental DOM:***
  - React: Uses a virtual DOM that is a full representation of the actual DOM, enabling efficient diffing and updating.
  - Angular: Does not use a virtual DOM. Instead, it uses the actual DOM directly but updates it incrementally, based on efficient compiled instructions.
  
- ***Update Granularity:***
  - React: Updates are based on the diff between two virtual DOMs, which is a separate layer from the actual DOM.
  - Angular: Updates are more direct and incremental, with checks happening against the actual DOM structure.

- ***Change Detection Process:***
  - React: Uses reconciliation to decide what parts of the DOM to update.
  - Angular: Uses change detection to directly update bindings and DOM nodes.

### Conclusion

While both React and Angular optimize DOM updates, their approaches differ fundamentally:
- React abstracts the update process using a virtual DOM, which it compares and syncs with the real DOM.
- Angular works directly with the real DOM, applying updates incrementally without maintaining a separate virtual DOM layer.
These differences lead to distinct performance characteristics and strategies for optimizing application rendering in each framework.

## Bootstraping angular app

Bootstrapping an Angular application refers to the process of initializing and starting up an Angular application. This process involves several steps:

`Angular Project => index.html => angular.json => main.ts => app.module.ts => app.component.ts`

- When the index.html file is loaded, Angular core libraries & third party libraries are also loaded by that time.
- Now angular locates the main entry point. To locate it, It goes to angular.json file.

  ```ts
  "options": {
            "outputPath": "dist/angular-ekart-new",
            "index": "src/index.html",
            "main": "src/main.ts", // main entry point
            "polyfills": [
              "zone.js"
            ],
            "tsConfig": "tsconfig.app.json",
            "inlineStyleLanguage": "scss",
            "assets": [
              "src/favicon.ico",
              "src/assets"
            ],
            "styles": [
              "src/styles.scss"
            ],
            "scripts": []
          },
  ```

- In main.ts file it calls ***`platformBrowserDynamic().bootstrapModule(AppModule)`***. This function is responsible for initializing the Angular application and starting the bootstrapping process. This fuctions loads the ***`AppModule`***.
  
- After main.ts angular goes to app.module.ts which has below code -

```ts
@NgModule({
  declarations: [
    AppComponent // all the pipes, components, directives etc are defined here
  ],
  imports: [
    BrowserModule, // external imports required
    AppRoutingModule
  ],
  providers: [], // all the services are provided here
  bootstrap: [AppComponent] // component to be loaded when this module is loaded
})
export class AppModule { }
```

- Then angular goes to the app.component.ts file were it accesses @Component decorator.

```ts
@Component({
  selector: 'app-root', // selector value can be used a html tag
  templateUrl: './app.component.html',
  styleUrls: ['./app.component.scss']
})
```

- Now whereever `app-root` is used a html tag the view template (app.component.html) is rendered.
