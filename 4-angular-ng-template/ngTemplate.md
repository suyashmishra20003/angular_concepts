# ng-template

In Angular, ng-template is a powerful directive that allows you to define template content that is not rendered by default but can be injected or projected into other parts of your application dynamically. This enables you to create reusable UI components, enhance code organization, and manage conditional rendering effectively.

## Key Characteristics

- Creates a template that remains hidden initially (no content displayed in the DOM).
- Can be associated with a template reference variable using `#templateName`.
- Provides flexibility for various use cases:
  - Conditional Rendering: Use structural directives like *ngIf or *ngSwitch to display the template based on conditions.
  - Content Projection: Project the template content into another component using the ng-content directive.
  - Customizing Components: Create reusable UI components with embedded ng-templates for dynamic content.
  - Creating DOM References: Use ViewContainerRef injected into the component to manipulate the DOM where the template is projected.
- `ngTemplateOutlet` is a powerful directive that allows you to dynamically render a template within the component's content.
- Instead of embedding the template statically in your HTML, you can define it separately and then use `ngTemplateOutlet` to display it based on certain conditions or data
  
### Example (Conditional Rendering)

```html
<h2>Learn NG Template</h2>
<ng-template #myTemplate>
  <h3>This is a template</h3>
  <p>This is an example paragraph to understand ng-template</p>
</ng-template>

<!--ngTemplateOutlet Directive-->
<ng-container *ngTemplateOutlet="myTemplate"></ng-container>
<div *ngTemplateOutlet="myTemplate"></div>
```

## Advantages of Using ng-template

- Promotes code reusability and modularity.
- Improves application maintainability by separating template logic.
- Enables dynamic UI interactions and conditional rendering.
- Enhances flexibility and control over content display.

## Best Practices

- Use ng-template strategically for appropriate use cases.
- Prioritize clarity and organization when defining templates.
- Consider performance implications when dealing with complex conditional rendering or content projection.
- Explore complementary techniques like components and services for advanced use cases.
- By effectively leveraging ng-template, you can create well-structured, reusable, and performant Angular applications that meet your UI requirements seamlessly.
